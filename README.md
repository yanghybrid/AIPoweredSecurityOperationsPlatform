1Ô∏è‚É£ System Overview
üéØ Key Features
	1.	Threat Intelligence Ingestion
	‚Ä¢	Collects security event logs from firewalls, SIEMs, endpoints, and network traffic.
	‚Ä¢	Supports structured and unstructured threat feeds (OSINT, commercial threat intelligence, etc.).
	2.	AI-Powered Threat Detection & Analytics
	‚Ä¢	Uses Machine Learning (ML) models to detect anomalies and security threats.
	‚Ä¢	Correlates data across sources to identify patterns of attacks (e.g., APTs, malware outbreaks).
	3.	Security Incident Response & Automation
	‚Ä¢	Integrates SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) to automate threat mitigation.
	‚Ä¢	Provides real-time alerts and remediation recommendations.
	4.	Dashboard & API Access
	‚Ä¢	Web-based real-time visualization of security threats.
	‚Ä¢	RESTful API for security teams to query alerts & threat intelligence.
	5.	Performance Monitoring & Security Compliance
	‚Ä¢	Uses New Relic for system monitoring and observability.
	‚Ä¢	Uses Tenable One for vulnerability management and compliance tracking.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Component Breakdown
3.1 Web UI & API Gateway
	‚Ä¢	Uses: Nginx as a reverse proxy to route API requests.
	‚Ä¢	Features:
	‚Ä¢	React-based Dashboard for visualizing security alerts.
	‚Ä¢	RESTful APIs (Ruby on Rails / Flask) for integrations.
	‚Ä¢	WebSockets for real-time threat updates.

3.2 AI-Powered Threat Detection
	‚Ä¢	Uses: Python (ML models), Ruby (data correlation).
	‚Ä¢	Techniques:
	‚Ä¢	Anomaly Detection (Detects deviations from normal traffic).
	‚Ä¢	Behavioral Analytics (Identifies malicious behavior over time).
	‚Ä¢	Threat Correlation (Cross-referencing logs with threat feeds).
	‚Ä¢	Example ML Model: Detecting Anomalous Network Activity

from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
import numpy as np

# Sample Network Traffic Data
network_data = np.random.rand(100, 5)  # Simulated log data
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.01)  
model.fit(network_data)

# Predict Anomalies
predictions = model.predict(network_data)
print(predictions)  # -1 indicates anomaly

3.3 Security Data Processing & ETL
	‚Ä¢	Uses: Ruby + Python
	‚Ä¢	Functions:
	‚Ä¢	Log Parsing & Normalization: Converts different security logs into a common format.
	‚Ä¢	Threat Intelligence Enrichment: Matches logs with known indicators of compromise (IoCs).
	‚Ä¢	Stream Processing: Uses AWS Kinesis to process logs in real-time.

3.4 Security Data Store (PostgreSQL)
	‚Ä¢	Stores:
	‚Ä¢	Security logs
	‚Ä¢	Threat indicators (IP, hashes, domains)
	‚Ä¢	ML training data
	‚Ä¢	Uses Partitioning & Indexing for fast retrieval.
Example Schema for Security Logs:

CREATE TABLE security_logs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    source_ip VARCHAR(50),
    destination_ip VARCHAR(50),
    event_type VARCHAR(100),
    threat_level INT
);

3.5 Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)
	‚Ä¢	AWS EC2: Runs backend processing & API services.
	‚Ä¢	AWS S3: Stores large security logs.
	‚Ä¢	AWS Lambda: Serverless functions for on-demand threat intelligence lookups.
	‚Ä¢	AWS Kinesis: Streams security logs for real-time processing.

3.6 Performance Monitoring & Security Compliance
	‚Ä¢	New Relic
	‚Ä¢	Monitors system performance (CPU, memory usage).
	‚Ä¢	Detects bottlenecks in log processing pipelines.
	‚Ä¢	Tenable One
	‚Ä¢	Tracks vulnerabilities in cloud infrastructure.
	‚Ä¢	Ensures compliance with security standards (SOC2, ISO 27001, etc.).


4Ô∏è‚É£ Scaling Considerations
Challenge	Solution
Handling High Traffic	Use Kafka / Kinesis for log streaming
Low-Latency ML Inference	Deploy ML models on AWS SageMaker
High Availability	Deploy on AWS Auto-Scaling + Multi-Region
